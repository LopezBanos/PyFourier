# PyFourier: A module for visualizing the Fourier Transform and its properties




## Installation

```
pip install PyFourier
```
## Usage
The way this package works is by defining an array of harmonics waves and adding them up to produce the animated plot using the 'wrap_plot()' class.

## 1D- Visual Examples

The PyFourier package allow you to work on the frequency domain which is neccesary in most of the cases.
